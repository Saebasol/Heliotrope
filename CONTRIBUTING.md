# Saebasol Common Contribution Guide

> This topic is a helpful guide when contributing to Saebasol-owned repositories.

## What you need to know before contributing

The develop branch should never be touched.
Please work on a branch that forked from the develop branch.

## Branch Naming

It is best to specify a type.  
> ex. feature/new-feature

## Commit convention

Basically follow the rules of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0).

It is best to specify a scope.  

> ex. feat(file): add new feature  

If there are common files, it is recommended to designate a folder unless it is a major item.  

> ex. feat(folder/file): add new feature
